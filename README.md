# Magic28

[Live demo](http://jack126guy.github.io/magic28/)

Magic28 ("magic two eight") is a re-creation of [xkcd's Emojic 8 Ball](http://xkcd.com/1525/) using [Twitter Emoji](http://github.com/twitter/twemoji) instead of raw text.

Not all systems have fonts with emoji installed, and Twitter's emoji library fixes this by providing images.

In addition, in Magic28 you can put your cursor over the emoji to get a description.

## Requirements

* jQuery
* Twitter Emoji (Twemoji)

## Notes

The permalink feature of the original Emojic 8 Ball is not yet supported in Magic28.

The images are derived from [File:Magic eight ball.png](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magic_eight_ball.png) on Wikimedia Commons, created by MZMcBride and released into the public domain.

## Name

The "magic" and "8" parts should be obvious. The "2" part is from the first part of "Twemoji", which is similar to "two" (I guess?).
